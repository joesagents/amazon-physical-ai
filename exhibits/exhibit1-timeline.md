- Goal: Reduce delivery times, lower costs

**Vulcan (2025) - Touch Sensing Robot**
- Amazon's first robot with tactile sensing
- Multi-modal sensing: vision + touch + force
- Can handle delicate/irregular items
- Learns manipulation strategies through experience
- Represents "mind + body" integration

**Blue Jay (2025) - High-Speed Conveyor Robot**
- Moves thousands of packages at high speeds
- Adaptive routing based on real-time conditions
- Coordination with other robots via foundation models

**Project Eluna - Agentic AI**
- Multi-agent coordination systems
- Robots that plan, reason, and collaborate
- Conversational interfaces (inspired by Alexa)
- Goal: Robots that take direction directly from people

**Sequoia (2025) - Integrated Inventory System**
- Full system integration of AI-powered robotics
- 25% faster processing times in new fulfillment centers (e.g., Shreveport, Louisiana)
- Creates 200+ new jobs per facility

### Key Characteristics of Physical AI Era:
1. **Foundation Models:** Pre-trained on massive robot data, fine-tuned for specific tasks
2. **Multi-Modal Sensing:** Vision + touch + force + proprioception
3. **Runtime Adaptation:** Learn and adjust in real-time, not just pre-programmed
4. **Safe Collaboration:** Work alongside humans in unstructured environments
5. **Agentic Behavior:** Plan, reason, coordinate with other robots
6. **Conversational Interfaces:** Natural language interaction

## Discussion Questions for Students

1. **Inflection Points:** Where do you see the major strategic shifts in this timeline? What triggered each shift?

2. **Scale Discipline:** How does operating at "billions of packages" scale change what's possible vs. what companies at smaller scale can do?

3. **Progression Logic:** Is the Structured → Semi-Structured → Unstructured progression inevitable, or could Amazon have jumped directly to Physical AI in 2012?

4. **Employment Paradox:** How do you reconcile 1M robots with adding hundreds of thousands of jobs? Is this sustainable long-term?

5. **Physical AI Timing:** Why 2024-2025 for Physical AI emergence? What technology precursors had to exist first?
