# Teaching Note: [CASE NAME]

**Case Type:** Archival | Decision
**Target Audience:** MBA, MSc (Operations, Strategy, Entrepreneurship)
**Class Time:** 120 minutes
**Difficulty:** [2, 2, 2] (Analytical, Ethical, Quantitative)

---

## Synopsis

[2-3 paragraph case summary: what happened, key decision/paradox, why it matters]

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this class, students will be able to:

1. **[LO 1 — Analytical]:** [Specific skill, e.g., "Trace how operational principles evolved across four phases of automation"]
2. **[LO 2 — Evaluative]:** [Specific skill, e.g., "Evaluate whether 'Physical AI' represents paradigm shift vs. incremental improvement"]
3. **[LO 3 — Synthesis]:** [Specific skill, e.g., "Identify which principles transfer beyond the case domain"]

**Bloom Taxonomy:** Levels 4-5 (Analyze, Evaluate)

---

## Pedagogical Strategy

**Case positions students as:**
- [ ] Decision-maker (protagonist perspective)
- [x] Analyst/observer (archival, multiple viewpoints)
- [ ] Strategist (forward-looking)

**Discussion structure:**
- Q1: Build analytical foundation (evidence gathering)
- Q2: Debate/evaluate (thesis vs. antithesis)
- Q3: Synthesize/transfer (principles beyond case)

**Engagement peak:** Q2 debate (allow 45 minutes)

---

## Question-by-Question Teaching Guide

### Question 1: [Analytical Question]

**Example:** "How did operational principles evolve across Amazon's four automation phases?"

**Purpose:** Build evidence foundation for later synthesis

**Expected student responses:**
- Theme 1: [e.g., "Safety focus constant across all phases"]
- Theme 2: [e.g., "Human-robot collaboration models evolved"]
- Theme 3: [e.g., "Customer obsession drove each technology shift"]

**Board structure (3 columns):**
| Phase | Principles | Evidence (from case) |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| 2012-2014 | [Principle] | [Exhibit/quote] |
| 2015-2018 | [Principle] | [Exhibit/quote] |
| 2019-2022 | [Principle] | [Exhibit/quote] |
| 2023-2024 | [Principle] | [Exhibit/quote] |

**Common misconceptions:**
1. **"Automation = job loss"**
   Correction: Case shows 1M robots + 500K jobs added (evidence in section X)

2. **"Safety is PR spin"**
   Correction: 30% injury drop + specific safety investments (exhibit Y)

**Exhibit usage:**
- **Exhibit 1 (Timeline):** Use to structure chronological analysis
- Call out: "What stayed constant vs. what changed?"

**Time allocation:** 45 minutes

---

### Question 2: [Evaluative Question — Debate]

**Example:** "Is 'Physical AI' a paradigm shift or incremental improvement marketed as revolution?"

**Purpose:** Force evidence-based argumentation, no "right" answer

**Expected debate positions:**

**Position A: Paradigm Shift**
- Evidence: Foundation models enable learning (not programmed rules)
- Evidence: Unstructured environments (vs. structured warehouses)
- Evidence: Sparrow adapts to 99.9% of SKUs vs. Kiva's rigid pods

**Position B: Incremental Improvement**
- Evidence: Still goods-to-person core logic
- Evidence: "Physical AI" coined by Amazon PR (marketing term)
- Evidence: Competitors using similar sensors + ML (not unique)

**Board structure (2 columns):**
| Paradigm Shift | Incremental Improvement |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| [Student argument + evidence] | [Student argument + evidence] |
| [Student argument + evidence] | [Student argument + evidence] |

**Instructor role:**
- Do NOT resolve debate (let evidence quality speak)
- Push for case grounding: "Where in the case supports that?"
- Surface counterpoints: "Who disagrees? What evidence counters this?"

**Exhibit usage:**
- **Exhibit 2 (Comparison Matrix):** Anchor debate in 12 dimensions
- Call out: "Which dimensions show fundamental vs. evolutionary change?"

**Common student mistakes:**
1. **Assertion without evidence:** "It's obviously a shift" (push for case support)
2. **Cherry-picking:** Using only favorable evidence (ask for counterpoints)
3. **External analogies:** Bringing in outside cases (redirect to this case's evidence)

**Time allocation:** 45 minutes (longest segment, most engaging)

---

### Question 3: [Synthesis/Transfer Question]

**Example:** "What corporate philosophies sustain Amazon's robotics strategy, and which transfer beyond logistics?"

**Purpose:** Extract principles, test portability

**Expected themes:**
- Purpose → Strategy → Operations framework (Exhibit 3)
- Customer obsession as organizing principle
- Vertical integration philosophy
- Employee experience as strategic (not just ethical)

**Board structure:**
| Principle | Case Evidence | Transfers to... | Limits (where it breaks) |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| [Principle 1] | [Amazon example] | [Other domain] | [Where it fails] |
| [Principle 2] | [Amazon example] | [Other domain] | [Where it fails] |

**Discussion prompts:**
- "Which principles are Amazon-specific vs. generalizable?"
- "Where would this philosophy fail? (healthcare? government?)"
- "Is the framework genuine architecture or post-hoc rationalization?"

**Exhibit usage:**
- **Exhibit 3 (Framework):** Use to organize principles

**Wrap-up reflection:**
Connect back to learning objectives. Ask: "What did you learn that you'll use in your next case/job?"

**Time allocation:** 20 minutes

## Pre-Class Preparation (Optional Assignment)

**If grading participation:**

Submit 1-page memo (due before class):
1. Your position on Q2 (paradigm shift yes/no) with 3 pieces of case evidence
2. One question you want discussed in class

**Rubric:**
- Evidence quality (60%): Specific case references, not assertions
- Argumentation (30%): Counterpoints considered
- Clarity (10%): Concise, well-structured

## Exhibits: Teaching Notes

### Exhibit 1: Timeline

**Student-facing caption:** "Use this timeline to trace how operational principles evolved..."

**Instructor notes:**
- Opening hook: Point to 2012 (Kiva) and 2024 (Sparrow) — "13 years, what changed?"
- Use to structure Q1 (chronological analysis)
- Highlight safety focus across all phases (constant principle)

### Exhibit 2: Classical vs. Physical AI Comparison

**Student-facing caption:** "Use this 12-dimension comparison to build arguments for/against paradigm shift..."

**Instructor notes:**
- Core of Q2 debate
- Key dimensions: Control paradigm (biggest shift), Programming method (fundamental change)
- Evolutionary dimensions: Sensing (better sensors ≠ paradigm shift), Task scope (still logistics)
- Push students to weight: "Which dimensions matter most for competitive advantage?"

### Exhibit 3: Purpose-Strategy-Operations Framework

**Student-facing caption:** "Use this framework to answer Q3..."

**Instructor notes:**
- Q3 synthesis tool
- Test authenticity: "Is this real architecture or post-hoc PR?"
- Counterexample prompt: "Where did Amazon violate this framework?" (pressure test)

## Common Discussion Pitfalls (How to Avoid)

1. **Students dominate with opinions, light on evidence**
   Fix: "That's interesting — where in the case supports that?"

2. **Discussion drifts to general AI/robotics (not this case)**
   Fix: Redirect to exhibits: "Let's look at Exhibit 2 — what does the case tell us?"

3. **Debate becomes abstract philosophy**
   Fix: "Let's test that claim with numbers — what data do we have?"

4. **Quiet students don't participate**
   Fix: Cold call with scaffolded questions: "What surprised you in section X?"

## Assessment (if graded case)

**Participation rubric:**
| Criteria | Weight | Excellent | Needs Improvement |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Evidence use | 40% | Cites specific case passages/exhibits | Assertions without grounding |
| Analysis depth | 30% | Synthesizes across themes | Surface-level observation |
| Engagement | 20% | Challenges peers constructively | Silent or dominates |
| Synthesis | 10% | Connects to broader principles | Stays case-specific |

**Written assignment (optional):**
Post-class reflection (500 words):
- Your final position on Q2 (after hearing debate)
- One principle you'll apply beyond this case
- One assumption the case challenged
