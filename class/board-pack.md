# Board Pack — Physical AI at Amazon

## Blackboard Layout (printable, 3-column setup)

**Column 1: Q1 - Operational Principles**
- Placement optimization (Kiva → DeepFleet)
- Human-machine collaboration (dual optimization)
- Safety through design (30% injury ↓)
- Reliability as discipline (99.99% uptime)

**Column 2: Q2 - Physical AI Debate**
*Marketing/Incremental:*
- ML not new (pre-2020)
- Same hardware + sensors
- Only warehouses (not farms/hospitals)
- AI hype cycle

*Paradigm Shift:*
- Structured → unstructured environments
- Single → multi-purpose systems
- Pre-programmed → learning
- Economic model shift (train once, deploy many)

**Column 3: Q3 - Philosophy Framework**
- Day 1 mentality (continuous reinvention)
- Purpose → Strategy → Operations
- Co-botics (augment, not replace)
- Building clock vs. robots

## Cold-Call Prompts
- **Opening:** "Tye Brady says 'The real headline isn't about robots—it's about people.' What's your reaction?"
- **Q1:** "Walk me through how Kiva works. What's the operational principle—not just mechanics?"
- **Q2 Debate Setup:** "Left side: Physical AI is marketing. Right side: paradigm shift. Find evidence in Exhibit 2."
- **Q3:** "Is Amazon building robots or building the clock?"

## Time Boxes (120-min class)
- 0–10: Opening hook (1M robots + 500K jobs paradox), frame LOs (10 min)
- 10–55: Q1 Operational Principles (45 min)
- 55–100: Q2 Physical AI Debate (45 min) — **most engaging, allow time**
- 100–120: Q3 Philosophy & Transfer (20 min)
- **Total: 120 minutes**

## Likely Wrong Turns (anticipate)
- **Q1:** Students describe Kiva mechanics without extracting principles
- **Q2:** Students hedge ("too early to tell") instead of taking evidence-based position
- **Q3:** Students cite philosophy without connecting to sustained innovation outcomes
- **All Qs:** Not referencing exhibits; accepting Brady's framing uncritically

## Learning Objectives (quick remind)
- **LO1 (Analyze):** Identify operational principles across 4-phase evolution
- **LO2 (Evaluate):** Take defensible position on Physical AI paradigm shift vs. incremental
- **LO3 (Synthesize):** Connect philosophy to sustained innovation; apply to other industries
