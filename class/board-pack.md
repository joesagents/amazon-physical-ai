[E.g., "Company deployed 1M robots but added 500K jobs — how?"]

**Frame learning objectives**

## Discussion Plan (3-Column Layout)

### Question 1: [Analytical Question]

| Cold Call | Board Column 1 | Board Column 2 | Board Column 3 |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| [Student name] | [Theme/evidence 1] | [Theme/evidence 2] | [Theme/evidence 3] |
| What evidence supports...? | [Student response] | [Student response] | [Student response] |
| How did X evolve...? | [Student response] | [Student response] | [Student response] |

**Synthesis:** [How to pull threads together]

---

### Question 2: [Evaluative Question — Debate]

|------------|----------|------------|----------|
| [Argument for] | [From case] | [Argument against] | [From case] |
| [Student contribution] | [Exhibit reference] | [Student contribution] | [Exhibit reference] |

**Synthesis:** [No "right" answer, but evidence quality matters]

---

### Question 3: [Synthesis/Transfer Question]

| Principle | Case Evidence | Transfer Domain |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| [Core principle 1] | [Example from case] | [Where else applies?] |
| [Core principle 2] | [Example from case] | [Where else applies?] |

**Wrap-up:** [Final reflection, connect to LOs]

---

## Backup Questions (if discussion stalls)

1. [Probing question]
2. [Evidence challenge]
3. [Counterpoint solicitation]

---

## Common Student Misconceptions (Be Ready)

1. **Misconception:** [Common wrong interpretation]
   **Correction:** [Redirect to evidence in case]

2. **Misconception:** [Common wrong interpretation]
   **Correction:** [Redirect to evidence in case]

## Assessment Rubric (if graded participation)

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| Excellent | Evidence-based argument, synthesis across exhibits, challenges peers constructively |
| Good | Clear position with case support, engages with 2+ themes |
| Satisfactory | Participates but light on evidence or synthesis |
| Needs improvement | Opinion without case grounding |

---

**Notes:**
- Allow debate time for Q2 (most engaging)
- Use exhibits as anchors when discussion drifts
- Cold call to ensure broad participation
