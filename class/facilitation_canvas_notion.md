# Facilitation Canvas: Physical AI at Amazon: From Kiva to Collaborative Intelligence

## Session Flow
- [ ] Intro (10 min) - Hook with 1M robots + 500K jobs paradox
- [ ] Question 1: Operational Principles (45 min)
- [ ] Question 2: Physical AI Paradigm Debate (45 min)
- [ ] Question 3: Philosophy & Future (30 min)
- [ ] Wrap-up (5 min)

## Evidence
_Do not pre-state governing principles; point to exhibits with why it matters._
| Exhibit | Key Point | Why It Matters |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| 1. Timeline (2012-2025) | Four-phase evolution: Kiva â†’ scaling â†’ collaborative â†’ Physical AI | Shows progression from structured to adaptive systems |
| 2. Classical vs. Physical AI | 12-dimension comparison (environment, purpose, learning, coordination, economics) | Critical for Q2 debate - evidence for both paradigm shift AND incremental |
| 3. Purpose-Strategy-Operations | Three-layer framework from customer purpose to operational execution | Explains sustained innovation culture for Q3 synthesis |

## Discussion Prompts
1. **Q1 (45 min):** "What operational principles have guided Amazon's shift from goods-to-person to collaborative intelligence?"
2. **Q2 (45 min):** "Does 'Physical AI' represent a new paradigm for human-machine collaboration or an incremental extension of automation?"
3. **Q3 (30 min):** "How do Amazon's philosophiesâ€”Day 1, build-it-yourself, co-boticsâ€”shape the future of Physical AI inside and beyond warehouses?"

**Clarifying Questions (no spoilers):**
- "What specific evidence in Exhibit 2 distinguishes classical automation from Physical AI?"
- "Which operational principles from Q1 appear in multiple phases of Exhibit 1's timeline?"
- "How does the Purpose-Strategy-Operations framework (Exhibit 3) connect to the employment paradox (1M robots + 500K jobs)?"

**Evidence Mapping (cite exhibits without recommendations):**
- **Paradigm Shift Position:** Map to Exhibit 2 dimensions: unstructured environments, multi-purpose systems, learning capability, distributed coordination, economic model change
- **Incremental Position:** Map to Exhibit 2 evidence: neural networks existed pre-2020, Physical AI deployed only in warehouses (not farms/healthcare), similar hardware sensors
- **Dual Optimization:** Map to Exhibit 3 strategy layer + case employment data (safety â†“30%, jobs +500K)

**Risk/Mitigation Exploration (for Q3 transferability):**
- **Risk 1:** Physical AI may only work at Amazon's scale (training cost, data volume) â†’ **Mitigation:** Foundation model economics (train once, deploy many contexts)
- **Risk 2:** Home environments vastly more complex than warehouses â†’ **Mitigation:** 20-year horizon; incremental transfer (agriculture, healthcare first)
