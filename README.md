# Amazon Physical AI: From Kiva to Collaborative Intelligence

**Case Type:** Archival
**Topics:** Operations, Robotics, AI, Supply Chain, Automation
**Difficulty:** [2, 2, 2] (Analytical, Ethical, Quantitative)
**Class Time:** 120 minutes
**Status:** Submission-Ready (4.6/5)

## Overview

In October 2024, Amazon Chief Technologist Tye Brady presented at MIT's MGAIC Symposium on thirteen years of fulfillment automation evolution—from Kiva's rigid goods-to-person systems (2012) through collaborative robotics to "Physical AI" (2024-2025). The timeline raised a paradox: Amazon had deployed over one million robots while adding hundreds of thousands of jobs and reporting a 30% drop in recordable injury rates.

This archival case examines how Amazon evolved its operational principles, whether "Physical AI" represents a genuine paradigm shift, and which design philosophies might transfer beyond logistics.

## Case Questions

1. **Operational Evolution:** How did Amazon's operational principles evolve across four automation phases (2012-2025)? What stayed constant and what changed?

2. **Paradigm Shift Debate:** Is "Physical AI" a genuine paradigm shift or incremental improvement marketed as revolution? What evidence supports each position?

3. **Transferable Principles:** What corporate philosophies sustain Amazon's robotics strategy, and which principles transfer beyond logistics?
